# CI/CD pipeline project.
---
- Create a static website locally.
- Push the website code to a 'github' repository.
- Create an S3 bucket on AWS and enable static website hosting.
- Publish the website on the AWS S3 bucket.
- Create an AWS IAM 'user' with read and write permissions for the S3 bucket (use an AWS 'Policy').
- For the 'user' also generate an Access key and a Secret Access key.
- Configure Github Actions on the repository webpage adding a 'YAML' file to syncronise the repository with the AWS S3 bucket. 
- Add the 'user' keys as 'github' repository secrets so they can be accessed by Github Actions.
- Test the set up. Make changes to the local files, push the changes to Github. Check to see that the changes have percolated up to the S3 static website.
