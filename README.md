# S3 static website project.
---
- Create a static website locally.
- Push the website code to a *Github* repository.
- Create an S3 bucket on AWS and enable static website hosting.
- Publish the website on the AWS S3 bucket.
- Create an AWS IAM *user* with read and write permissions for the S3 bucket (use an AWS *Policy*).
- For the IAM *user* also generate an Access key and a Secret Access key.
- Configure *Github Actions* on the repository webpage adding a *YAML* file to syncronise the repository with the AWS S3 bucket. 
- Add the *user* keys as *Github* repository secrets so they can be accessed by *Github Actions*.
- Test the set up. Make changes to the local files, push the changes to Github. Check to see that the changes have percolated up to the S3 static website.
